# Fall 2022

# Lecture 4 Lab: Evaluating Projects 
In Lecture 3 we took a look at activities that maintainers of OSI-licensed software projects could do to build on-ramps to engage users, 
developers, and contributors to the project. 
In the first Lecture, we built the Apache webserver from source, following along from a 'found' web page in the project's website. 
In this lab, we will use the activities list to test build another project (from a list), evaluating the projects (and the activity list). 
(Docker makes for a contained environment on a Mac or Windows laptop. [Instructions for setting up Docker are here.](https://github.com/jhu-ospo-courses/JHU-EN.601.270/blob/main/Fall_2022/Docker_Setup.md#setting-up-for-labs))

## Objectives
* Evaluate the experience of downloading and **building** another open source licensed software project from a short list of projects. 
* Report on the experience using the criteria from Lectures 3 and 4. 

## Instructions
We are going to treat this as the technical challenge in the Great British Bake-off. 
There will be broad instructions and some clues along the way, but you are pretty much doing the work without a lot of hand holding.
Unlike the Bake-off, you are welcome to work together, 
and I'm available to answer questions. 
Your goal is to produce a simple report that lists the project, your build experience, and evaluates the project you chose against the criteria. 

We are going to use a more simplified list of activities. 
I do not expect students to be investigating or evaluating complex build environments for contributors. 

**Choose one of the following projects.**
1. Perl, a foundational scripting language for systems administration and building (early) dynamic web sites. 
1. Python, an important programming language in the scientific, machine learning, and research community (and other places). 
1. Node, a programming environment for server-side javascript programming. 

### The Report
The report for your exploration should itemize the following. 
If you are working with partners, you only need to email ONE report for all students.  
* Your name and email. (Make sure everyone's names and email addresses are on the report if you are working with partners.) 
* The name of the project you are evaluating
* Answers the following items:
1. Project Website: Provide a URL to the project website. 
1. Project License: Provide a URL to the project license.
1. Introductory Documents: Were there getting started documents or tutorials? (Provide any URLs.) 
1. FAQ: Was there an FAQ? (Provide the URL if you found one.)
1. User Installation: Does it look like you can install the project executables without building the project from source? (URL?) What platforms are supported? 
1. Installer Support: What was the installer for your platform? (For example, is there a brew installer for Mac OS?)
1. Bugtracking/Issues: Does it look like there is bugtracking or issue tracking available? (URL?)
1. How-to: Are there instructions for how to file a bug/issue for the project? 
1. Source Availability: Was complete source published and easy to find/download? (URL?) 
1. Building the Project from Source: Are there good instructions for how to build the project? (URL?) How did your build go? 
1. Testing to a Known State: Is there a test suite and a way to test the build? (URL?)
1. Design or Architectural Documentation: Did there appear to be architectural documentation of any kind? A design document? 
1. Project Communications: Could you find an IRC/Slack channel, any email distribution lists, or forums? 
(You do not have to join them. If you found a URL/page describing available channels, include it.) 
1. The Project Mission: Is there a mission statement for the project? (List URL.) 
1. Code-of-Conduct: Is there a code of conduct? (List URL.) 
1. Contributions: Could you find getting involved instructions or contribution guidelines? (You know the drill: list the URL.)
1. Meet-ups and Learning Forums: Can you find reference to any conferences or meet-ups for the project?
1. Source Code Base: Use `cloc` to determine how big the source code base is. 
1. Your Evaluation: In purely subjective terms, how did you find the whole experience? 

Email it to me at swalli1 at jh.edu when you are finished. 
If you worked with others, remember to include everyone's name on a single report. 

### The Investigation
The search engine is your friend. 
Trying simple explicit searches is best. For example:
1. `<project name> open source`
1. `build <project name> from source`
1. `<project name> license`
1. `<project name> meetup`

While many mature projects have moved to [GitHub](http://www.github.com) from their original forge sites, 
they often maintain project sites as well as GitHub sites. 
Some projects pre-date GitHub and have their own rich sites 
(e.g., Perl has https://www.perl.org/ as well as https://www.cpan.org/ for all of the Perl language plug-ins and the Perl source, 
and they also have a GitHub site https://github.com/Perl/perl5). 


### Trial Builds
You are expected to follow the build instructions (once found) to see if the instructions are accurate.
If your build fails at any step in the instructions, then note that failure in your report. 
Did the build seem to succeed but the testing failed? Note that appropriately. 
Were you able to still partially build and install? 



# Student Projects

## Lutece Projects
### Lutece #1: [New plugin development] Similar Availabilities
**Description:** 
A frequent request we have is for the development of a functionality that allows to find common availabilities in order to 
arrange a meeting time. In a similar way to doodle, the application must allow in the back office to set :
- date ranges on which participants define the time slots where they are available
- time slots
- A list of participants to send the invitation to
- A range of publication dates
- an option to be notified at each contribution / when all participants have filled in their availability
- Match the contributions of all to extract a synthesis (common time slots for all, or those with the most participants)
- ... (any ideas are welcome)

In front-office :
- The login is mandatory to access the functionality
- participants can easily (as user-friendly as possible) enter their availability
- They must be able to modify their contributions during the publication period, or as long as everyone has not responded, 
or as the owner/admin hasn't stopped the campain
- (any ideas are welcome)  

**Language:** Java/Javascript </br>
**Mentor:** Lutece Team </br>
**Difficulty:** Level 2/5 </br>

### Lutece #2: [New plugin development] Sheperd
**Description:** 
To improve the distribution and use of lutece in a broad way, we are developing a set of functionalities that will allow to quickly 
learn how to use the business bricks.

We want to set up a wizard that allows the user (back office or front office) to understand how to use the interface. 
Upon a new connection (identified thanks to the cookies), the wizard will automatically launch and suggest to the user to follow a 
guide explaining each element of the page and how to relaunch it once closed. Ideally present on each page, a button allows to launch the dedicated scenario.

Pre-requisite: use a library like sheperdjs, or compatible with our BSD license, e.g. Apache commons, GPL > 3, MIT...)

We would start on the Lutece core project, to help the understanding of RBAC for example, it could then be extended to the plugins 
integrated in the site.

A static example is available and can be shown/run, but needs a better integration and an way to edit the scenarios in the back-office 
and link them to the pages where they need to be accessible. </br>
**Language:** Java/Javascript </br>
**Mentor:** Lutece Team <br>
**Difficulty:** Level 2/5 </br>

### Lutece #3: [New plugin development] New resource management system<br>
**Description:** 
A new plugin that manages items/resources would be very useful to connect to other plugins.
It would define ressource types along with parameters (duration, pre-reqs, documents – editable fields 
based on the generic-attributes plugin). It would also be indexed and available through SolR (already existing plugin). 
If possible, add a front office page for users to browse through resources and use a filter-based and facets-based search.

It would allow people to either use the resources or borrow them on a specific time range. It would be as generic as possible 
(items, rooms, musical instruments…) and it would be a plus if the user could combine resources (looking for an available trumpet 
and a rehearsal room between Tuesday and Thursday for half a day). </br>
**Language:** Java/Javascript </br>
**Mentor:** Lutece Team </br>
**Difficulty:** Level: 3/5 for the management system in Back Office - 4/5 with indexation + front office </br>

### Lutece #4: [Plugin contribution] Resource management system module to use within the appointment plugin.
**Description:** 
A Lutece module is considered as a plugins plugin. Plugins bring features to Lutece websites. Modules connect plugins. For example, the appointment plugin features all that is needed to set agendas, availabilities and so on. The workflow plugin brings automation and configurable actions when a resource (request, appointment…) reaches new states. A module that connects the appointment plugin with the workflow plugin (and called module-appointment-workflow) brings all the appointment specificities into the workflow so that we can use business-related functions when appointments switch states.

Currently, such a module exists linking the resource plugin to the appointment plugin. It helps to associate a resource (equipment, staff…) with an appointment, but it can only be done manually : an admin choses a resource from a list and assigns it to the appointment so it is not longer available in the timeslot. The module needs to be upgraded so that this action can be done automatically, according to a few settings :
- Pick randomly from the list
- Choose an item so that it leverages the load of all, or on the contrary the most used so the others don’t get worn out
- Handle the case if no resources are available (notification to the admin, etc.)  

**Language:** Java/Javascript </br>
**Mentor:** Lutece Team </br>
**Difficulty:** Level: 3/5 starting from a fork - 4/5 otherwise </br>

### Lutece  #5: [New module development] Appointment queuing management system<br>
**Description:** 
This feature is highly requested by business units across the City. Since the appointment plugin is used to display 
availabilities for more than 400 services, some of them have very high demand. That means there are a few availabilities 
and users hardly find any. In a first version, we would love to provide them the possibility to register to a list that 
would be notified every time there are new availabilities – on a date range, or time range - due to cancelations or new 
timeslots added (any ideas to be as user-friendly as possible are welcome).</br>

## PatternFly projects
### PatternFly #1: Convert interactive component examples from Javascript to Typescript (Multiple Students)
**Description:**
PatternFly examples provide interactive working code snippets which illustrate different use cases to consumers and allow them to try out various interactions.  These examples were originally written in Javascript + React, but are being converted to Typescript + React to provide increased guardrails around their usage and better match the current technologies of our consumers.  Each PatternFly component typically contains several exaamples, so this project allows a student to ramp up in complexity while offering a quick path to making pull request contributions and see their work reflected on our live website.
</br>
**Additional information:** This work consists of many smaller issues contained within one large epic.  All mentors and the greater team have experience with this workflow, and existing completed work serves as a template to help students ramp up quickly.  Students will work into PatternFly's 3-week sprint schedule.</br>
**Expected outcomes:** Students will gain confidence in Typescript, be able to submit multiple pull requests building towards this goal, and see completed work reflected live to our community on the PatternFly website.</br>
**Language:** Javascript, Typescript, React</br>
**Skills/Background:** </br>
**Mentors:** Austin & Eric</br>
**Difficulty:** Medium </br>

### PatternFly #2: Update component unit tests to meet new standards with React Testing Library (Multiple Students)
**Description:**
PatternFly is used by individual consumers and massive corporate software alike, and as such must maintain a focus on consistency and reliability even while releasing every three weeks.  To this end the PatternFly team implements several different methods for testing code to ensure no breaking changes are introduced - unit tests, snapshot tests, integration tests, accessibility testing, manual end-to-end testing, and more.  The team's goal is to reimplement unit tests with React Testing Library, which will be enable support for React 18 while allowing the team to ensure that tests are accurately covering all required test cases and not providing a false sense of security.</br>
**Additional information:**  This work consists of many smaller issues contained within one large epic.  The PatternFly team has recently ramped up on React Testing Library ([documentation captured here](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/wiki/React-Testing-Library-Basics,-Best-Practices,-and-Guidelines)) and are happy to bring a student up to speed on this technology as well, so no React Testing Library prior experience is required.

### PatternFly #3: Improve PatternFly.org website's accessibility (Multiple Students)
**Description:**
PatternFly prides itself on putting a focus on accessibility into every decision - the design system should cater to all users, regardless of their specific abilities.  In addition to the code the team ships and is consumed by users, the documentation website which not only provides general information about PatternFly but also interactive examples and demos should maintain a focus on accessibility.  This project is aimed to resolve many accessibility bugs identified across the PatternFly website, which can be related to specific component HTML/Handlebars or React/Typescript code examples, custom code used specifically to build out the website, or other combinations of issues.  Errors have been pre-identified by the React team, and this project consists of a number of smaller code contributions that can be split up across multiple pull requests.</br>
**Additional information:**  This work consists of many smaller issues contained within one large epic.  Previous accessibility work is not required to be successful.  Existing completed work serves as templates that students can reference.  Students will work into PatternFly's 3-week sprint schedule.</br>
**Expected outcomes:** Students will gain understanding of & appreciation for accessible web experiences, and learn about automated accessibility testing through aXe, keyboard interaction, and screen readers.  They will be able to contribute multiple smaller pull requests towards this larger epic, and their work will have immediate impacts on PatternFly's website.</br>

## .NET Projects
### .NET #1: Convert assembly code in block diagram using Graphviz
**Description:** 
.NET Runtime is responsible for executing .NET applications. It compiles the user code into machine code. .NET developers validate the compilation correctness by printing the machine code in human-readable assembly code. Assembly code are set of sequential instructions with control flow jumping to various places within the method. In this project, we will convert the assembly code in graphical format using [Graphviz](https://sketchviz.com/graphviz-examples).</br>
**Additional information:** https://gist.github.com/kunalspathak/0dae8e63acf4bcadf50b432196a3c45a </br>

**Mentor:** Kunal Pathak </br>
**Difficulty:** Easy/Medium </br>

### .NET #2: Search patterns in assembly code
**Description:** 
.NET Runtime developers try to optimize the machine code generated for .NET applications. To better focus on impactful scenarios, we often need to scan through the assembly code produced and find patterns that are more common than others. If they find out that a particular pattern has high frequency occurrence and can be optimized further, they prioritize those optimizations. The question is how to generalize such pattern searching? </br>
